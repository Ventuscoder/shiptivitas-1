My process to crack this task:
1. Understand the different functions and parameters of the Dragula module and implement it
2. Organize the starting data given
3. Determine the changes I need to make:
    - Get hold of the data-status attribute
    - Get hold of the CURRENT parent of a card once it gets dropped
    - Set the classes based on the above, in order to change the color successfully
